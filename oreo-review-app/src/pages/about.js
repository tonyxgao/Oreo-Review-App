      <p>
        The idea for this project came from the fact that I have tried pretty
        much every Oreo flavor that has released since my freshman year of high
        school (that was about 8 years ago). While I do love Oreos, I think I'm
        more in love with just the pure novelty of flavors that come out.{' '}
      </p>

      <p>
        While I've tried all of them within the continental United States, I
        know there are definitely so many more out there in the world! Trying to
        get there one bite at a time! Regardless, kudos to the food scientsits
        over at Nabisco! You guys are killing it!{' '}
      </p>

      <p>
        This project was just a proof of concept that I did for a work-class
        project. I definitely know there's a ton left that I can do, but just
        wanted to get something out there before the end of the day!{' '}
