# Oreo-Review-App

## Preface
The following application was made as part of an assignment for the coding bootcamp I'm in. 

The task was to learn one language, framework, or technology that was not taught in the class and implement it in a day. I chose Gatsby.js as it was something one of my instructors mentioned would make for a good tool for a side-project I was thinking of.

## About this Project
This application is meant to archive all the Oreos I've eaten and along with a rating and review for each flavor I've had. As of right now, the current data is a bit sparse and was just used as an MVP for my assignment.

## Future Work
There are a ton of different things I'd like to do with this project. Here are some coming down the pipeline:
- Add styling (there's still quite a few remenants of the Gatsby starter code in my project)
- Add full CRUD functionalities for this project (currently it is just static data)
- Find a database / API that actually can pull information on Oreos (particularly with flavor and picture).
